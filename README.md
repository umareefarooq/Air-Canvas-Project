# Air-Canvas-Project
Air Canvas is a program which can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of a coloured marker with a camera. The tip of the finger is used as the marker.
I have used the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project. The preferred language is Python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use syntax but understanding the basics it can be implemented in any OpenCV supported language.
